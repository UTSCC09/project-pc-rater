**Description:** \
PCRater is a web application that provides a central platform for students to come and join forums for their courses. Users can join classes as students, TAs or even professors based on their assigned role in the class. As a result, the students will be able to figure out the answers to their questions and doubts, which will improve their success rate. Every course in every university will have its own specific forum where users can participate and interact with one another. The forum will also support an option for questions and polls. In addition, users can have follow-up discussions on every post on the app. That way, they can clarify anything that makes them uncertain about a question or a response from a course's instructor or any of their classmates.

Users must create an account to create post on a course's forum. They will need to enter the necessary details, including their name, school, email, etc. Users must sign up or sign in to interact with our web app. 

All users who have an account can create posts, leave comments, upvote other posts and commments. Also, users are able to edit and modify their posts.

Professors will now be able to host virtual office hours and meetings with students by using the video call functinality of the class's forum.
The virtual room will support audio (including mute and unmute), video communication between multiple participants, screen sharing, drawing board, and a chat as well.

**Technology Stack:** \
Our main stack we will be using is the MERN stack (which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) as well as GraphQL. 
For the frontend, we will be using React, which is a JavaScript library which is built on top of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To improve the responsive design of our app, we will also use Bootstrap, which is an extensive and customizable library that will allow us to build better designs faster. It will also help us to adapt our design to mobile devices.

For the backend, we will be using Graphql, which is a framework that will help us to handle the routing, requests, cookies, sessions, security, etc. 
GraphQL will make the data query and manipulation easier for us. MongoDB is the NoSQL database our app will use to store data. 

To support the video communication, we will use Web RTC frameworks such as simple-peer and socket.io, which will peer-to-peer connection API on the browser in real time.


**Technical Challenges:**
<ul>
 <li>Allowing students to comment on the posts. Designing the discussion forum layout might be challenging for us as well as designing the database schema to support that.</li>
 <li>Learning and working with new programming languages, applications and frameworks such as REACT, GraphQL, MongoDB with no previous exposure.</li>
 <li>Obtaining large amounts of data about courses and professors for the various colleges and universities around Ontario.</li>
 <li>The Deployment process of the application on a VM.</li>
 <li>Establishing application security for the app.</li>
</ul>
